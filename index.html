                <p>The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents that was invented in the 1990s and now encompasses around 30 billion pages from around the world.</p>
        
                <p>All sorts of files can be found on the web, such as text, images, videos and music.</p>
        
                <h3>You and the server</h3>
                <p>
                A computer requests data from a remote server using HTTP, the main protocol of the web. A web browser then interprets and displays the data on a screen for the user <em>           (that's you!)</em> to see.
            </p>
        
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>
                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the heart of the web. HTML documents                   form the majority of the content on the web, including text, images, videos and music.                 HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which                     describes "how it looks".
            </p>
        
                <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
                <p>HTML documents are made of elements, which include a set of tags and content within those tags. HTML elements can be either inline or block.</p>
                <pre>&lt;tag_name&gt; contents &lt;/tag_name&gt;</pre>
                <p>One thing to remember is that computers are stupid. They only understand what a programmer explicitly tells them to do. For example, if there is no closing tag on an element, the last command will continue to be valid until the computer sees a corresponding closing tag.</p>
                <p>An HTML tag can have multiple attributes, or additional descriptors.</p>
                <pre>&lt;tag_name attr="value"&gt; contents &lt;/tag_name&gt;</pre>
                <p>The <span class="inlinecode">&lt;a&gt;</span> tag, or anchor tag, has an attribute of 'href' followed by a value of the attribute, which in this case, is the URL of a link.</p>
                <pre>&lt;a href="URL"&gt; contents &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
                <p>Similarly, the <span class="inlinecode">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag has an attribute of 'src', with the value being the name of the image file. In addition to the image source, it's often recommended to also include an 'alt' attribute with the value being alternative text that is displayed when the image won't load. Note that the <span class="inlinecode">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag does not contain any content, and so has no closing tag. The <span class="inlinecode">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag is considered a "void tag".</p>
                <pre>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="alternate text"&gt;</pre>
                <p>Another void tag is the <span class="inlinecode">&lt;br&gt;</span> tag; it is merely a line break, without any content associated with it. It's used to separate lines of text, since in HTML, all whitespace is rendered as a single space.</p>
                <p>Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="inlinecode">&lt;p&gt;</span> : paragraph</li>
                    <li><span class="inlinecode">&lt;div&gt;</span> : section division</li>
                </ul>
        
                Inline tags include:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="inlinecode">&lt;br&gt;</span> : break, or new line</li>
                    <li><span class="inlinecode">&lt;em&gt;</span> : italics</li>
                    <li><span class="inlinecode">&lt;b&gt;</span> : bold</li>
                    <li><span class="inlinecode">&lt;img&gt;</span> : image</li>
                    <li><span class="inlinecode">&lt;span&gt;</span> : often used to add styling</li>                       <li>and others.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
       
            <div class="banner-title">Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</div>
            <div class="content-wrap">
            
                <p>If a website is seen as a structure, or say, a house, then:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>HTML</b> is the structure: the walls, the room divisions, where each room is located.</li>
                    <li><b>CSS</b> is the style: wall color, curtains, decorations, carpeting.</li>
                    <li><b>Javascript</b> is the interactive component: the TV, the garage door opener.</li>                   </ul>
                <p>HTML and CSS are both languages, with their own specific rules and syntax, just as the English language has grammatical rules. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a> <em>[Document Object Model]</em> is a convention for representing and interacting with HTML elements.</p>
                <p>Because each element in a page is rectangular, a design can be broken down into a series of nesting boxes. Each box can be identified by a <span class="inlinecode">&lt;div&gt;</span> tag, and content can be added within the opening and closing tags. The nesting of the boxes creates the tree-like structure of HTML, called the DOM tree. A nested element is indented from the parent element above. The more indented the element, the more nested the box.</p>
                <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, determine the look of the website, including position, color, font, and margins.  Each box, or each <span class="inlinecode">&lt;div&gt;</span> element, can be styled using individual class attributes, sort of like tags on boxes, to help you remember what those boxes are for. Just as you would label a physical box with a meaningful name, class attributes should also have meaningful names.

            <div class="content-wrap">
    
                <h3>Don't Repeat Yourself</h3>
        
                <p>When writing CSS, you may realize that you want several of the same type of elements to have the same look. You can give each element their own individual styling, and repeat the same style for each element, possibly with minor adjustments. If you ever want to make a change to all elements, you would have to go through and individually change each style. Having many repetitions like this in your code can often lead to user error and typographical mistakes.</p>
                <p>By establish unique class attributes for each type of element, you would only need to change the style for that class, and those changes will be reflected in all the elements that use the specified class. This can save both time and trouble.</p>
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>As mentioned before, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The "style sheets" part is easy to understand; it's the "cascading" part that can cause some confusion.</p>
                <p>When styles are cascaded, the most specific rule is applied to every element. The program will continue traveling down the cascade of elements and rules until it come to one that best describes the element; that becomes the rule that is applied to the element.</p>
                <p>A selector is what determines the element a rule is applied to. For instance, to apply a style to a class, use
                <pre>.classname {attribute: value;}</pre>
                <p>There are 3 different ways to apply CSS to a webpage:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add <span class="inlinecode">&lt;style&gt;</span> elements to the <span class="inlinecode">&lt;head&gt;</span> section of the website.</li>
                    <li>Link a separate .css file to the html file with a <span class="inlinecode">&lt;link&gt;</span> element in the <span class="inlinecode">&lt;head&gt;</span> element of your website.<pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"&gt;</pre></li>
                    <li>Write the styling inline into the HTML. This can be useful in certain cases, but should be used carefully to avoid unnecessary repetition.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Comments</h3>
                <p>Comments are lines of text that the computer will ignore. They are used as notes to help explain sections of code, or as reminders to users who read the code long after it's been written.</p>
                <p>HTML comments begin with <span class="inlinecode">&lt;!--</span> and end with <span class="inlinecode">--&gt;</span>.</p>
                <p>CSS comments begin with <span class="inlinecode">/*</span> and end with <span class="inlinecode">*/</span>.</p>
                <h3>HTML Boxes and Positioning</h3>  
                <p>All HTML elements are rectangular, or boxes, and each of those boxes have 4 components: the content, the padding, the border and the margin. Each of these components can be adjusted individually using CSS, and it can get confusing  when trying to determine the final size of an element. Two techniques to help with sizing issues are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use percents instead of pixels when sizing boxes. This will size the boxes relatively vs setting an absolute size.</li>
                    <li>Set the <span class="inlinecode">box-sizing</span> attribute to <span class="inlinecode">border-box</span> for every element. In order to ensure this command works on all browsers, be sure to add browser specific prefixes:
                    <pre>
*{
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
    -ms-box-sizing: border-box;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}</pre></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Since &lt;div&gt; tags are block elements, by default, they take up the entire width of the website. To override this behavior, use <span class="inlinecode">display: flex;</span> so that <span class="inlinecode">&lt;div&gt;</span> sections can appear next to each other.</p>
                <h3>Coding and Testing</h3>
                <p>To test changes in CSS, you can open Developer Tools in the browser and adjust the CSS code on the fly for each element you see on the page. These changes are temporary and are only meant to give a preview of what the change will look like. Once you are happy with the styling, you can go back to your CSS code and make the changes permanent.</p>
